# website
this is our website holding information about us and our blog!

im really shit at making websites, so any contributions are appreciated

most of the shit youre concerned with should be covered in `themes/spcy`, but if you want to change the posts themselves they are just in the `content/posts` category

have fun!

(p.s we use nix here because im a huge fan of nix heheheheheheheheheheheeheheheh)
