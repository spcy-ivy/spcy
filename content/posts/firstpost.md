read the homepage if you want a tldr, but if youre geniunely interested in us (for some sick and twisted reason) you can read further!

# whyd you make this group?
i just made the group so that all of my future revenue would go toward the group and i could compensate anyone who helped

idk why i expanded it to like a whole ass website... but you know what its a fun idea and grorwing a community is worth a try

# why do you want everything open sourced?
1. making modding possible
2. anyone inspired can just take the code
3. being proprietary is kinda boring

# ok... but why creative commons in particular?
because MIT is lame and generic and boring and i just want people to be able to do whatever they want

# why typescript?
stop asking so many questions

also because the type system is just much better than what we have with luau and jsx
